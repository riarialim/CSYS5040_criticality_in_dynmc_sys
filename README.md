# CSYS5040 Criticality in Dynamical Systems  
This repository contains my assignment submissions and analysis for the postgraduate unit **CSYS5040: Criticality in Dynamical Systems**. The unit focused on the behavior of complex systems near critical thresholds, exploring nonlinear dynamics, stochastic processes, bifurcations, and early warning signals. All computational work was completed using **Wolfram Mathematica**.

## Assignment 2: Simulating Critical Behavior in Dynamical Systems
- Simulations of both **linear** and **nonlinear** stochastic differential equations (SDEs).
- Visualisation of parameter-driven transitions and critical points.
- Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process modeling.
- First-passage time analysis with confidence intervals.
- Exploration of multiple equilibria and tipping point dynamics.

## Assignment 3: Complexity & Early Warning Signals in Paleoclimate Data
- Time series analysis of the **GISP2 Greenland Ice Core** temperature record.
- Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) and Recurrence Plots.
- Computation of:
  - Hurst Exponent
  - Sample Entropy
  - Burstiness
- Critical slowing down (CSD) metrics including rolling-window:
  - Variance  
  - Autocorrelation  
  - Skewness & Kurtosis
- Analysis of abrupt transitions during the **Bølling–Allerød** warming and the **Younger Dryas**.

## Personal Learning Note

> Prior to this unit, I had never used **Mathematica**. I self-taught the platform over the span of a few weeks and successfully completed two advanced assignments entirely in Mathematica. This experience demonstrates my adaptability and ability to rapidly acquire and apply new computational tools under academic pressure.
